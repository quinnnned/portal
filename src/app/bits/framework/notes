Goals:
    * LiveObjects, updated automatically via websocket tag-based subscripton
    * Each LiveObject has the following methods:
        * .onChange()
        * .unsubscribe()
    * Object-properties of a live object are also live objects, subscribed on a get action
    * LiveArrays - arrays of LiveObjects
    * root LiveObject 'my'.  All LiveObjects and LiveArrays stem from here
    * object consumer (angular2 component, probably) is ignorant of db actions
    * simple Class-based persister with validation
    * Permissions.
    
    
let's say 'my'
