PERSISTER:
* The persister's job is storage and retieval.
* It does NOT know about classes or metadata.
* It only deals with 'Persistable' objects and 'Link' objects
* Persistable (Interface) means that it has getKey() :string and getGroup() :string
* PersistableLink (Interface): getParentGroup():string, getChildGroup():string,
* IDEA (for later) maybe each persister implemenation can have its own Persistable definition
  * Use case: mysql/cassandra tables with composite keys
  * The persistable interface would then just have:
    * getRecordIdentifier() :any
  * probably a requirement to be jsonable?
  * maybe have a memory hashtable for the ids?
  * dunno. Just ideas.
